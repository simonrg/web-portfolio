<p>Update on the state of the site: looking around at the site currently I want to make it clear this is all still a work in progress. I am building this site at the same time as I am creating the content for it so please understand its a very time consuming process. Functionally speaking, in terms of the site build, anything that is live here is derived from the repository master branch and has been tested and is working as intended.</p> 

<p>I do want to address though how it looks like a lot of the content isn't currently being loaded. Images are simply not showing because there is no content currently to show. Like I said, I'm still in the process of migrating A LOT of stuff from a physical medium to digital. Ontop of that I have to organise and categorise all the content so it is rendered correctly, but the core functionality for HOW that works is implemented. The homepage banner for instance is pulling in images uploaded to Cloudinary with a specific tag. I deliberately haven't begun tagging every image for the banner because I haven't uploaded all the work I want to feature, and I haven't decided how it will be displayed as I am trying to decide how to deal with performance issues related to 'above-the-fold' rendering. Also, the homepage design itself is still a work in progress.</p>

<p>So yeah that all being said it should go without saying; the markup, functionality and styling (especially) may be subject to change.</p>

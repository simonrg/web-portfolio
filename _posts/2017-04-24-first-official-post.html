<p>So I did it, I've finally started building a website! This has been a long time coming, given my background in computer science and enjoyment of website development. And yet despite that the website is an illustration portfolio. Regardless, I think this website can help showcase the best of my work and current experience in both the art and technology fields.</p>

<p>This has been the plan for a while so its great to finally start putting it all together. I know there are alternatives like DeviantArt and Portfoliobox for maintaining an art portfolio online, but the purpose of custom building this website is twofold. 1) Once this site is more fully fleshed out I'll have something that I can show to potential employers. 2) My drawings are now publicly viewable somewhere. It's really a win-win situation.</p>

<p>But aside from that this will pretty much serve as a bookend for starting the blog portion of this website. I'm not sure of the regularity I will make blog posts, but it does provide a nice outlet to vent, and its cool to mess around with Jekyll's blog functionality. I'm already preferring this compared to having an overly bloated cms e.g. Drupal or Wordpress, messing around with custom content types, plugins and templates just to retrieve and organise data in the back end. I'd like to get some more time to try building a site from scratch with Druapl but that's pretty overkill for what I'm trying to accomplish here..</p>

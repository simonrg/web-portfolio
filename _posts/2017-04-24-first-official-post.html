So I finally did it, I've gone about and finally built a website! Well started building anyway. This has certainly been a long time coming, given my aspiring career as a front end developer and my passion for drawing, it seemed like a natural fit. Theres something truly cathartic about finally starting to put together this website where I can finally organise my work a bit better in a more public way, without having to resort to hosting it somewhere like deviantart or portfoliobox. Plus once this site is more fully fleshed out I'll have something that I can chuck into a portfolio to show off for my ongoing job search. Its a win, win, win.

But aside from that this will pretty much serve as a bookend for starting the blog portion of this website. I'm not sure of the regularity I will post these given thats not really the purpose of the site, but like I said before it does provide a nice outlet to vent, and its a great way to play around with Jekyll's blogging functionality. I'm already preferring this compared to having an overly bloated cms e.g. Drupal, messing around with custom content types, plugins and templates just to retrieve and organise data in the back end. It'd be nice to play with more but pretty overkill for what I'm trying to accomplish here.

<p>I've realised something interesting whilst putting this blog together. That having a system where posts are standard .html files that are commit to source control completely negate the need for editing because the first post you make is just going to be stored in the project's history for eternity anyway. Interesting side effect of how this is all put together. I've been looking up solutions for how to deal with this but it seems to just be an accepted limitation. It just feels wrong to me, committing content to the repository. Sorta defeats the purpose of making it a publicly accessible project. That said its still a better alternative to setting up another repository purely for content.</p>
